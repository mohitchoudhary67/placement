        "question":" Why is the operating system important",
        "answer": "OS is the most essential and vital part of a computer without which it is considered useless. It enables an interface or acts like a link for interaction between computer software that is installed on OS and users. It also helps to communicate with hardware and also maintains balance among hardware and CPU. It also provides services to users and a platform for programs to run on. It performs all common tasks applications require."

    {
        "question":"What's the main purpose of an OS? What are the different types of OS",
        "answer": "The main purpose of an OS is to execute user programs and make it easier for users to understand and interact with computers as well as run applications. It is specially designed to ensure that the computer system performs better by managing all computational activities. It also manages computer memory, processes, and operation of all hardware and software. Types of OS: Batched OS (Example: Payroll System, Transactions Process, etc.), Multi-Programmed(Example: Windows O/S, UNIX O/S, etc.), Timesharing OS (Example: Multics, etc.), Distributed OS (LOCUS, etc.), Real-Time OS (PSOS, VRTX, etc.)"

        "question":"What are the benefits of a multiprocessor system",
        "answer":"A Multiprocessor system is a type of system that includes two or more CPUs. It involves the processing of different computer programs at the same time mostly by a computer system with two or more CPUs that are sharing single memory. Such systems are used widely nowadays to improve performance in systems that are running multiple programs concurrently. By increasing the number of processors, a greater number of tasks can be completed in unit time. One also gets a considerable increase in throughput and is cost-effective also as all processors share the same resources. It simply improves the reliability of the computer system."

        "question":"What is RAID structure in OS",
        "answer":"RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) is a method used to store data on Multiple hard disks therefore it is considered as data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple hard disks. It simply balances data protection, system performance, storage space, etc. It is used to improve the overall performance and reliability of data storage. It also increases the storage capacity of the system and its main purpose is to achieve data redundancy to reduce data loss"
    },
    {
        "question":" What are the different levels of RAID configuration",
        "answer":"RAID 0 - Non-redundant striping: This level is used to increase the performance of the server RAID 1 - Mirroring and duplexing: This level is also known as disk mirroring and is considered the simplest way to implement fault tolerance. RAID 2 - Memory-style error-correcting codes: This level generally uses dedicated hamming code parity I.e., a liner form of error correction code. RAID 3 - Bit-interleaved Parity: This level requires a dedicated parity drive to store parity information. RAID 4 - Block-interleaved Parity: This level is similar to RAID 5 but the only difference is that this level confines all parity data to a single drive. RAID 5 - Block-interleaved distributed Parity: This level provides far better performance than disk mirroring and fault tolerance. RAID 6 - P+Q Redundancy: This level generally provides fault tolerance for two drive failures"

        "question":"Explain demand paging",
        "answer":"Demand paging is a method that loads pages into memory on demand. This method is mostly used in virtual memory. In this, a page is only brought into memory when a location on that particular page is referenced during execution."
    },
    {
        "question":"What is different between main memory and secondary memory. ",
        "answer":"Main memory => Main memory in a computer is RAM (Random Access Memory). It is also known as primary memory or read-write memory or internal memory. The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory.Secondary memory => Secondary memory in a computer are storage devices that can store data and programs. It is also known as external memory or additional memory or backup memory or auxiliary memory. Such storage devices are capable of storing high-volume data. Storage devices can be hard drives, USB flash drives, CDs, etc. "
    },
    {
        "question":"What is Virtual Memory",
        "answer":"Virtual memory uses both hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. Mapping chunks of memory to disk files enables a computer to treat secondary memory as though it were main memory."
